        <h2>Parachute Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Parachutes have many novel applications including NASAâ€™s space travel
          missions and military operations. Parachutes with enhanced performance
          and safety are needed to perform these functions. The goal of this
          project was to design a parachute with improved performance using
          novel canopy materials. Five different canopy materials were tested:
          Electrospun Nanofiber-Nylon, Nylon, Rayon, Terylene, and Cotton. Model
          parachutes of identical size (30 cm diameter) and shape (circle) using
          these materials were made and dropped from a constant height with an
          identical weight load. Parachute performance was determined using drag
          time, drop velocity, canopy performance, descent performance, and path
          of descent. The Electrospun Nanofiber Nylon canopy parachute performed
          the best with the longest drag time and slowest drop velocity compared
          to Nylon and all other materials tested. The Nanofiber Nylon has
          higher available surface area to interact with the air molecules,
          which increases air resistance, thus increasing drag time and slowing
          down drop velocity. This experiment shows that Nanofiber Nylon canopy
          material enhances parachute performance compared to the current
          parachutes made with Nylon canopy.
