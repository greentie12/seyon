          <p>
            <strong>Objective</strong>: The objective of this project was to
            develop an object detection neural network model to identify
            recyclable plastic water bottles with high accuracy of >75%.
            <strong>Background</strong>: Plastic pollution has reached crisis
            proportions in the US. About 91% of recyclable plastic end up in
            natural environments and plastic water bottles are one of the major
            contributors to pollution. Technology-integrated automation can
            improve plastic recycling. <strong>Methods</strong>: We used
            TensorFlow with Python API to create the neural network object
            recognition model to identify common brands of recyclable plastic
            water bottles with >75% accuracy. We created a customized library
            with 300 images of the most common brands of plastic water bottles
            and trained it over 2000 times. We tested the performance of the
            model by feeding real-time live images of common brands of plastic
            water bottles and other random objects via the laptopâ€™s webcam and
            recording the live detection confidence scores &#40;% accuracy&#41;,
            number of trials with accurate labeling, and false-positive results
            with ten trials. <strong>Results</strong>: The object recognition
            neural network model detected and identified the common, popular
            brands of plastic water bottles with an average live accuracy of
            >90%. Plastic water bottles were accurately labeled in all trials
            &#40;10/10&#41; and the pop-up alert message with information on how
            to recycle plastic water bottles was displayed only when plastic
            water bottles were detected in all trials &#40;10/10&#41;. There was
            zero &#40;0/10&#41; false positive detection for other objects
            presented. <strong>Conclusion</strong>: The customized object
            recognition model developed and integrated with a webcam was highly
            accurate and detected recyclable plastic water bottles with > 90%
            accuracy.
