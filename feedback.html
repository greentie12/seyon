          management/EPA. The possible extensions to your project are
          intriguing. In your presentation, include the sources for facts you
          present. Your diligence in formulate-test-analyze-fix sequence is

          These two students did an excellent job of designing a great tool for
          identifying recyclable plastic. They were able to answer all of our
          questions and I wish them great luck in the next phase. I liked how
          they overcame some programming and software challenges and devised
          adequate solutions.
